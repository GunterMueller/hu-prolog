HU-Prolog
=========

"HU Prolog" - a portable prolog interpreter from the '80s 

HU-Prolog was originally written by 3 people @ Humboldt-University Berlin (East Germany). See License.txt for more information.
 
It is written in C, K&R (pre Ansi-C) style. Most comments are in German - because this where the '80s in East Germany.

It may or may not compile on todays systems (is still working on current MacOS 10.10, but seems to have issues on the travis-ci 64bit Ubuntu platform.

In the last ~30 years (~1987 and 2016), the performance increased by a factor of 2^14 - just by recompiling the programm on a modern MacBook instead of a Z8000 16bit Machine.
